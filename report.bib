	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbial life dominates the earth, but many species
are difficult or even impossible to study under laboratory conditions.
Sequencing DNA directly from the environment, a technique commonly
referred to as metagenomics, is an important tool for cataloging
microbial life. This culture-independent approach involves collecting
samples that include microbes in them, extracting DNA from the
samples, and sequencing the DNA. A sample may contain many different
microorganisms, macroorganisms, and even free-floating environmental
DNA. A fundamental challenge in metagenomics has been estimating
the abundance of organisms in a sample based on the frequency
with which the organism's DNA was observed in reads generated
via DNA sequencing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We created
mixtures of ten microbial species for which genome sequences are
known. Each mixture contained an equal number of cells of each
species. We then extracted DNA from the mixtures, sequenced the
DNA, and measured the frequency with which genomic regions from
each organism was observed in the sequenced DNA. We found that
the observed frequency of reads mapping to each organism did not
reflect the equal numbers of cells that were known to be included
in each mixture. The relative organism abundances varied significantly
depending on the DNA extraction and sequencing protocol utilized.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We describe a new data resource for
measuring the accuracy of metagenomic binning methods, created
by in vitro-simulation of a metagenomic community. Our in vitro
simulation can be used to complement previous in silico benchmark
studies. In constructing a synthetic community and sequencing
its metagenome, we encountered several sources of observation
bias that likely affect most metagenomic experiments to date and
present challenges for comparative metagenomic studies. DNA preparation
methods have a particularly profound effect in our study, implying
that samples prepared with different protocols are not suitable
for comparative metagenomics.}

generate reads from a microbial environment in order to analyze
the microbial community. However, assembling of a set of mixed
reads from different species to form contigs is a bottleneck of
metagenomic research. Although there are many assemblers for assembling
reads from a single genome, there are no assemblers for assembling
reads in metagenomic data without reference genome sequences.
Moreover, the performances of these assemblers on metagenomic
data are far from satisfactory, because of the existence of common
regions in the genomes of subspecies and species, which make the
assembly problem much more complicated. RESULTS: We introduce
the Meta-IDBA algorithm for assembling reads in metagenomic data,
which contain multiple genomes from different species. There are
two core steps in Meta-IDBA. It first tries to partition the de
Bruijn graph into isolated components of different species based
on an important observation. Then, for each component, it captures
the slight variants of the genomes of subspecies from the same
species by multiple alignments and represents the genome of one
species, using a consensus sequence. Comparison of the performances
of Meta-IDBA and existing assemblers, such as Velvet and Abyss
for different metagenomic datasets shows that Meta-IDBA can reconstruct
longer contigs with similar accuracy. AVAILABILITY: Meta-IDBA

environments, generated using 454 pyrosequencing of partial (400

composition altered at broad and finer-scale phylogenetic levels.
Analogous to faunal communities within brackish conditions, we
identified a bacterial brackish water community comprising a diverse
combination of freshwater and marine groups, along with populations
unique to this environment. As water residence times in the Baltic
Sea exceed 3 years, the observed bacterial community cannot be
the result of mixing of fresh water and saltwater, but our study

of the nature of microbial communities, simulating metagenomic
sequences plays an important role in testing the performance of
existing tools and data analysis methods with metagenomic data.
We developed metagenomic read simulators with platform-specific
(Sanger, pyrosequencing, Illumina) base-error models, and simulated
metagenomes of differing community complexities. We first evaluated
the effect of rigorous quality control on Illumina data. Although
quality filtering removed a large proportion of the data, it greatly
improved the accuracy and contig lengths of resulting assemblies.
We then compared the quality-trimmed Illumina assemblies to those
from Sanger and pyrosequencing. For the simple community (10 genomes)
all sequencing technologies assembled a similar amount and accurately
represented the expected functional composition. For the more
complex community (100 genomes) Illumina produced the best assemblies
and more correctly resembled the expected functional composition.
For the most complex community (400 genomes) there was very little
assembly of reads from any sequencing technology. However, due
to the longer read length the Sanger reads still represented the
overall functional composition reasonably well. We further examined
the effect of scaffolding of contigs using paired-end Illumina
reads. It dramatically increased contig lengths of the simple
community and yielded minor improvements to the more complex communities.
Although the increase in contig length was accompanied by increased
chimericity, it resulted in more complete genes and a better characterization
of  the functional repertoire. The metagenomic simulators developed
for this research are freely available.}

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: With a whole genome duplication event and wealth of
biological data,  salmonids are excellent model organisms for
studying evolutionary processes, fates of duplicated genes and
genetic and physiological processes associated with complex behavioral
phenotypes. It is surprising therefore, that no salmonid genome
has been sequenced. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a good representative
salmonid for sequencing given its importance in aquaculture and
the genomic resources available. However, the size and complexity
of the genome combined with the lack of a sequenced reference
genome from a closely related fish makes assembly challenging.
Given the cost and time limitations of Sanger sequencing as well
as recent improvements to next generation sequencing technologies,
we examined the feasibility of using the Genome Sequencer (GS)
FLX pyrosequencing system to obtain the sequence of a salmonid
genome. Eight pooled BACs belonging to a minimum tiling path covering
approximately 1 Mb of the Atlantic salmon genome were sequenced
by GS FLX shotgun and Long Paired End sequencing and compared
with a ninth BAC sequenced by Sanger sequencing of a shotgun library.
RESULTS: An initial assembly using only GS FLX shotgun sequences
(average read length 248.5 bp) with approximately 30x coverage
allowed gene identification, but was incomplete even when 126
Sanger-generated BAC-end sequences (approximately 0.09x coverage)
were incorporated. The addition of paired end sequencing reads
(additional approximately 26x coverage) produced a final assembly
comprising 175  contigs assembled into four scaffolds with 171
gaps. Sanger sequencing of the ninth BAC (approximately 10.5x
coverage) produced nine contigs and two scaffolds. The number
of scaffolds produced by the GS FLX assembly was comparable to
Sanger-generated sequencing; however, the number of gaps was much
higher in the GS FLX assembly. CONCLUSION: These results represent
the first use of GS FLX paired end reads for de novo sequence
assembly. Our data demonstrated that this improved the GS FLX
assemblies; however, with respect to de novo sequencing of complex
genomes, the GS FLX technology is limited to gene mining and establishing
a set of ordered sequence contigs. Currently, for a salmonid reference
sequence,  it appears that a substantial portion of sequencing
should be done using Sanger technology.}

we created simulated reads providing approximately 10-fold coverage

simulated reads yielded nearly complete coverage  of the respective

the D. melanogaster genome yielded approximately 98\% coverage
with an N50 contig length  of 324 kb and an N50 supercontig length

small errors occurred at a frequency of roughly 1 per 1 Mb (typically,

it on a range of assembly problems. We show that Minimus performs
well on several small assembly tasks, including the assembly of
viral genomes, individual genes, and BAC clones. In addition,
we evaluate Minimus' performance in assembling bacterial genomes

CONCLUSION: We find that for small genomes and other small assembly

we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled

communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects
to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing
their diversity  and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis
showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of
diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational
taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities
found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3\% dissimilarity) with only  78
of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability
was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at
great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their
structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on
membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject
variability in community structure was lower than site differences
between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These
differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were
mostly caused by  the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella
haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental
and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comprehensive annotation and quantification of transcriptomes
are outstanding problems in functional genomics. While high throughput
mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing
these problems, its success is dependent upon the availability
and quality of reference genome sequences, thus limiting the organisms
to which it can be applied. RESULTS: Here, we describe Rnnotator,
an automated software pipeline that generates transcript models
by de novo assembly of RNA-Seq data without the need  for a reference
genome. We have applied the Rnnotator assembly pipeline to two
yeast transcriptomes and compared the results to the reference
gene catalogs of these organisms. The contigs produced by Rnnotator
are highly accurate (95\%) and  reconstruct full-length genes
for the majority of the existing gene models (54.3\%). Furthermore,
our analyses revealed many novel transcribed regions that are
absent from well annotated genomes, suggesting Rnnotator serves
as a complementary approach to analysis based on a reference genome
for comprehensive  transcriptomics. CONCLUSIONS: These results
demonstrate that the Rnnotator pipeline is able to reconstruct
full-length transcripts in the absence of a complete reference
genome.}

of whole-genome  sequencing, allowing scientists to initiate numerous
projects to decode the genomes of previously unsequenced organisms.
The lowest-cost technology can generate deep coverage of most
species, including mammals, in just a few days. The sequence data
generated by one of these projects consist of millions or billions
of short DNA sequences (reads) that range from 50 to 150 nt in
length. These sequences must then be assembled de novo before
most genome analyses can begin. Unfortunately, genome assembly
remains a very difficult problem, made more difficult by shorter
reads and unreliable long-range linking information. In this study,
we evaluated several of the leading de novo assembly algorithms
on four different short-read data sets, all generated by Illumina
sequencers. Our results describe the relative performance of the
different assemblers as well as other significant differences
in assembly difficulty that appear to be inherent in the  genomes
themselves. Three overarching conclusions are apparent: first,
that data  quality, rather than the assembler itself, has a dramatic
effect on the quality of an assembled genome; second, that the
degree of contiguity of an assembly varies enormously among different
assemblers and different genomes; and third, that the correctness
of an assembly also varies widely and is not well correlated with
statistics on contiguity. To enable others to replicate our results,
all of  our data and methods are freely available, as are all
assemblers used in this study.}

to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years.
Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient

heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing
error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce
longer  reads and others are expected to become available soon.
For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2
remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially
slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per
unit time. RESULTS: We designed and implemented a new  algorithm,
Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to
align  long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database
(e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm
is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several
to tens of times faster than both. AVAILABILITY: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net}

has been limited by the remarkable diversity and vast size of
microbial communities. As a result, few microbial systems have
been sampled with sufficient depth to generate reliable estimates
of the community SAD. We have used a novel approach to characterize
the SAD of bacterial communities by coupling genomic DNA fractionation
with analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms
(GC-TRFLP). Examination of a soil microbial community through
GC-TRFLP revealed 731 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
that followed a lognormal distribution. To recover the same 731
OTUs through analysis of DNA sequence data is estimated to require
analysis of 86,264  16S rRNA sequences. The approach is examined
and validated through construction and analysis of simulated microbial
communities in silico. Additional simulations performed to assess
the potential effects of PCR bias show that biased amplification
can cause a community whose distribution follows a power-law function
to appear lognormally distributed. We also show that TRFLP analysis,
in  contrast to GC-TRFLP, is not able to effectively distinguish
between competing SAD models. Our analysis supports use of the
lognormal as the null distribution for studying the SAD of bacterial
communities as for plant and animal communities.}

	abstract = {The whole-genome sequence assembly (WGSA) problem is among one
of the most studied problems in computational biology. Despite
the availability of a plethora of tools (i.e., assemblers), all
claiming to have solved the WGSA problem, little has been done
to systematically compare their accuracy and power. Traditional
methods rely on standard metrics and read simulation: while on
the one hand, metrics like N50 and number of contigs focus only
on size without proportionately emphasizing the information about
the correctness of the assembly, comparisons performed on simulated
dataset, on the other hand, can be highly biased by the non-realistic
assumptions in the underlying read generator. Recently the Feature
Response Curve (FRC) method was proposed to assess the overall
assembly quality and correctness: FRC transparently captures the
trade-offs between contigs' quality against their sizes. Nevertheless,
the relationship among the different features and their relative
importance remains unknown. In particular, FRC cannot account
for the correlation among the different features. We analyzed
the correlation among different features in order to better describe
their relationships and their importance in gauging assembly quality
and correctness. In particular, using multivariate techniques
like principal and independent component analysis we were able
to estimate the "excess-dimensionality" of the feature space.
Moreover, principal component analysis allowed us to show how
poorly the acclaimed N50 metric describes the assembly quality.
Applying independent component analysis we identified a subset
of features that better describe the assemblers performances.
We demonstrated that by focusing on a reduced set of highly informative
features we can use the FRC curve to better describe and compare
the performances of different assemblers. Moreover, as a by-product
of our analysis, we discovered how often evaluation based on simulated
data, obtained with state of the art simulators, lead to not-so-realistic
results.}

evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and
for automatically detecting  any errors they may contain. Current
methods do not fully meet this need because  they require a reference,
only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack
statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagenome
assemblies. RESULTS: In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood
Evaluation (ALE) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically
evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent
manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive,
and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert
length (for paired-end  reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment
and k-mer frequency. ALE pinpoints synthetic errors in both single
and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, insertions/deletions,
genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes.
At the genome level with real-world data, ALE identifies three
large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished
genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences
sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, ALE recovers
215 of 222 (97\%) single nucleotide variants in a training set
from a GC-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific
Biosciences data, ALE identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in
a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences' own
variant caller, EviCons. In summary, the ALE framework provides
a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous
measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which
can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly
process. AVAILABILITY: ALE is released as open source software
